Test script for EMACSS v2.1. This is princiapally designed to operate as a stand alone test script for the compiled version of EMACSS. It intends to  validate EMACSS by confirming the results generated confirm to known values. We aim to have four sections to the validation:

1. Bounds validation - affirms that unreaslistic cluster setups are correctly rejected at input. This also entends to clusters far out of bounds.
 
2. Input validation - confirms that the range of cluster inputs is correctly undersood. This class will also test a) that the default function calls (relaxation time, jacobi radius) are operating correctly, b) that the scaling factors are correctly calculated.

3. Output validation - tests the outputs supplied make sense for the required options.

4. Equal mass runtime validation - tests the output reduced by the code is (within a small tolerance) idential to published results from AG2012. This confirms that the code 'does what it should', and is able to reprodice the evoltuion represented in that paper
