	 EMACSS is a numerical integrator that solves for the
	 differential equations:

	  dE/dt = f(N,r,p) = - epsilon*E/t_rh

	  dN/dt = g(N,r,p) = - xi*N/t_rh

	  dr/dt = h(N,r,p) = mu*r/t_rh

	  dmm/dt = i(N,r,p) = (gamma_se+gamma_dyn)*mm/t_rh

	 where 
	 epsilon = max((2 + X)*gamma_se,zeta) 
	 xi = f(N,r,rt)
	 mu = epsilon - 2*xi - 2*gamma_se - 2*gamma_dyn
	 gamma_se = nu*trh/t	 gamma_dyn = A*xi/(1+(1-DM_SE)/(F*N*mm))
	 p is an array of variables defining the conditions at any given time.
	 zeta defines the fractional flow of energy per half-mass
	 relaxation time and stellar evolution.

	 DM_SE is the mass lost due to stellar evoltuion only

	 X, A and F are constants calibrated against N-body runs

	 Full documentation is available in Alexander & Gieles 2012 and 
	 in Alexander, Gieles, Lamers and Baumgardt 2013 (in prep) and 

	 The options to specify a cluster (initial number of stars,
	 half mass radius) can be specified with appropriate options 
	 (see below) 
	 The output is printed directly onto the command line; we 
	 therefore suggest piping this output into a file or plotting
	 package.

	 emacss [options] > [output]

	 Although note that the output is formatted (see 'head' for the 
	 format of output files. 

	 Options:
	 -help: Displays this file.
	 -version: Displays the current version number and version log.
	 -o: (Output) N-body or Real units. 
		 0=N-body (see Heggie & Mathieu 1986)
		 1=Real [parsec, solar masses, Myr] 
		 2=Real and N-body alternating 
	 -N: initial number of stars in cluster.
	 -r: initial half-mass radius of cluster [ignored if u = 0 ]
	 -m: mean mass of stars [solar masses].
	 -t: Output time (i.e., for single output after set time).
	 -R: initial ratio of virial to Jacobi radius.
	 -M: mass of point mass galaxy around which the cluster is
	     in orbit [M_sun].
	 -d: distance to the point mass galaxy around which the cluster
	     is in orbit [kpc].
	 -v: Orbital velocity of cluster around galaxy. [km/s]
	 -z: value for zeta. Defaults:
		 0.111-equal mass clusters, no stellar evolution.
		 0.15-stellar evolution on, clusters assumed with Krouper 
		 stellar IMF.
	 -s: Stellar Evolution flag (0 = off, equal mass, 1 = on, IMF.

	 Tidal field is specified first by MG and RG, if these are
	 provided. If one or both are missing, the code will first 
	 attempt to use orbital velocity, then filling factor rhrj.

	 When options are not defined a default cluster is used with:
	 N=1e5
	 mm=0.547 M_sun
	 r=1pc
	 RG=8.5kpc
	 vG=220kms^-2

	 If used to represent clusters of equal mass stars, the code
	 is only accurate once balanced evolution has begun (no 
	 core-collapse).

	 Happy evolving!
