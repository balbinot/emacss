Basic interface version for EMACSS to use with Python scripts.

This version is based on the prototype version of EMACSS III, as of 28/10/13, and allows EMACSS to evolve a cluster from input time t_1 to t_2. 

This version does not support the sequential evolution of a single cluster (e.g. in the tidal field of a Milky Way like galaxy), although can evolve a single cluster for a specif iced period of time.

An example of the usage of this code is provided in interface.py,, and the python module to use with the code is provided in emacss_module.py. Note that the link in this module must be changed to the local path to libemacss.so. Briefly, the code requires input in the form of an array:

t_1    t_2    N    mm   r  MG    RG    vG    zeta

where t_1 and t_2 are the times at the start and end of evolution, N is the number of stars, mm is the mean mass of stars, and r is the half mass radius. MG, RG and vG refer to the Galaxy mass, galactocentric distance and orbital velocity, while zeta is the fractional conduction of energy per trh for a balanced cluster.

The output is now and array:

t_2    N    M    r    rJ    tcc  ntrh'

where the quantities are the same as in the input, with M total mass, rJ the Jacobi radius, tcc the core collapse time (in Myr) and ntrh' the number of elapsed (modified) relaxation times.. 

All units throughout are physical (M_sun, pc) expect RG (kpc).
