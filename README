	 EMACSS is a numerical integrator that solves for the
	 differential equations:

	  dE/dt = f(N,r,p) = - epsilon*E/t_rh

	  dN/dt = g(N,r,p) = - xi*N/t_rh

	  drh/dt = h(N,r,p) = mu*r/t_rh

	  drc/dt = h(N,r,p) = delta*r/t_rh

	  dk/dt = h(N,r,p) = lambda*r/t_rh

	 where 
	 epsilon = -lambda+mu+2xi 
	 xi = f(N,r,rt)
	 mu = f(rh,rt,rc,N,kappa)
	 delta = f(t_rh,t_rc,N,xi)
	 lambda = f(rc,rh,kappa)

	 p is an array of variables defining the conditions at any given time.
	 zeta defines the fractional flow of energy per half-mass
	 relaxation time and stellar evolution.

	 Full documentation is available in Alexander & Gieles 2012, 
	 Gieles, Alexander, Lamers and Baumgardt 2013.

	 The options to specify a cluster (initial number of stars,
	 half mass radius) can be specified with appropriate options 
	 (see below) 
	 The output is printed directly onto the command line; we 
	 therefore suggest piping this output into a file or plotting
	 package.

	 emacss [options] > [output]

	 Although note that the output is formatted (see 'head' for the 
	 format of output files. 

	 Options:
	 -help: Displays this file.
	 -version: Displays the current version number and version log.
	 -o: (Output) N-body or Real units. 
		 0=N-body (see Heggie & Mathieu 1986)
		 1=Real [parsec, solar masses, Myr] 
		 2=Real and N-body alternating 
	 -N: initial number of stars in cluster.
	 -r: initial half-mass radius of cluster. 
	 -m: mean mass of stars [solar masses].
	 -R: initial ratio of half-mass to Jacobi radius.
	 -g: Galaxy type: 0 - isolated, 1 = point mass, 2 = isothermal
	 -M: mass of point mass galaxy around which the cluster is
	     in orbit [units set by -o].
	 -d: distance to the point mass galaxy around which the cluster
	     is in orbit [units set by -o].
	 -v: Orbital velocity of cluster around galaxy. [units set by 
	     -o]
	 -z: value for zeta. Defaults to 0.111 for equal mass clusters.

	 Tidal field is specified first by MG and RG, if these are
	 provided. If one or both are missing, the code will first 
	 attempt to use orbital velocity, then filling factor rhrj.

	 When options are not defined an isolated cluster is used with:
	 N=1e5

	 If used to represent clusters of equal mass stars, the code
	 is only accurate from the start (i.e., throughout core 
	 collapse.

	 The default output is N-body units. If option 2 is used
	 N-body and real units alternate. 

	 Happy evolving!
